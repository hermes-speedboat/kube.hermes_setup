## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-10

- Tunes installer and example resource defaults for small K3s/lab deployments: 100m CPU requests, 1 CPU limits, 256Mi Agent/WebUI memory requests, 96Mi Dashboard memory request, 128Mi Browserless memory request, and 1Gi memory limits.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Adds opt-in bootstrap support through `HERMES_BOOTSTRAP_DIR` for `SOUL.md`, durable memories, skills, plugins, cron configuration, workspace files, and optional authentication state.
- Adds a reusable universal systems-architect bootstrap profile covering platform operations, architecture, research, QA, and software development.
- Exposes the mounted workspace through the Dashboard file browser and configures safe write roots for Agent, Dashboard, and WebUI.

### Changed

- Raises the default WebUI upload limit for large documents.
- Tunes public-example resource requests and limits for practical lab deployments.

### Upgrade notes
